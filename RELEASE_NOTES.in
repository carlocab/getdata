GetData 0.7.3 fixes a few bugs found since the release of GetData-0.7.2. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three packages are available:
* getdata-0.7.3.tar.bz2/.gz: the full source code to the library, with
    bindings.  This package uses the GNU autotools build system, and is
    designed for POSIX systems (UNIX, Linux, BSD, MacOS X, Cygwin, MSys, &c.)
* getdata_win-0.7.3.zip: a reduced source code package, with the CMake build
    system designed to be built on Microsoft Windows, either using the free
    MinGW compiler, or else Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler.  (The full
    source package above can also be built using MinGW, if the MSys shell is
    used to run the build system.) Currently, the only bindings provided by
    this package are the C++ bindings, and the package lacks support for
    compressed dirfiles, the Legacy API, and a few other features.  This
    build is used in native Microsoft Windows builds of kst2.
* idl_getdata-0.7.3.tar.bz2/.gz: the Interactive Data Language (IDL) bindings,
    packaged separately with an autotools build system, designed to be built
    against an already installed version of GetData.  Due to licensing
    restrictions, pre-built packages rarely come with these bindings, and
    this package allows end-users to add support for IDL without having to
    recompile the whole GetData package.
